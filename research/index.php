            I am an Assistant Professor of Computer and System Engineering at Minia University in Egypt.
            I got my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the
            <a href="http://www.ece.vt.edu" target="_blank">Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>
            at <a href="http://www.vt.edu" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>, where I worked with
            <a href="http://www.hume.vt.edu/~tcc" target="_blank">Prof. Charles Clancy</a> in the
            <a href="http://www.hume.vt.edu" target="_blank">Hume Center for National Security and Technology</a>.
            I earned my B.S. degree in Computer and System Engineering in 2005 from the
            <a href="http://eng.asu.edu.eg" target="_blank">Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University</a> in
            Cairo, Egypt.
            In 2010, I joined the Direct Ph.D. program in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, and got my M.S.
            degree in 2013 and my Ph.D. degree in 2017.
            My current research interests include applying machine learning to mobile and cloud computing and security.

            and remediation. The Prezi below gives an overview of how the system works.
